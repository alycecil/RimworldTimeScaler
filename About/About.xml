	<description>Slider for time rate, ultra speed key (4) always unlocked as well as step by tick... if you wanted to
		
		POWERED BY HARMONY
		
		How this works
		Two Patches, all c#:
		TickManager_TickRateMultiplier = Slider times a fitted function to make the slider not zoom out of the way
		TimeControls_DoTimeControlsGUI = redo the renderer as a slider and pause button as well as redo the key bindings with non locked up. keeps tutorial tags and is new or existing game friendly.
		
		
		this mod is in the public domain and will always be available at github.com/alycecil
